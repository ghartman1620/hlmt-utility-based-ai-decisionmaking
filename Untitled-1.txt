i would like to be able to put an object in my actors
and give the object some actions, and for each action give it some axis

ActionDecider a = new ActionDecier();
a.addAction(run_away);
a.addAxis(run_away, function_that_returns_input(), min_input_val, max_input_val, curve, inverted);


then come along later and ask:
myAction = a.decideAction();
myAction();

Do, according to the api, actions have duration? Can an action complete? If so, it's sort of tied in
with the game loop, which I don't want the system to interface with. Alternately, perhaps
